VisualME7Logger
===============

Continuing development on the already open source VisualME7Logger. This Application pulls data in real time from the Motronic (ME7.1) ECU currently used in select Audi/VW vehicles. The purpose of this application is to pull real-time data to visually monitor specific variables within the engine management system.
